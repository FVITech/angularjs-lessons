##Exercise 1

- Consume data from the following api endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Present data on a web page following the same concepts presented thus far in class.

Please don't copy and paste code. Write it from memory. If you need to refer to the code, that's ok, but please write it from memory. It's the only way it will stick, and maximize comprehension. Don't be shy about asking for help if you get stuck.

Please post your code to github, and email me the link. This does count for a grade.
