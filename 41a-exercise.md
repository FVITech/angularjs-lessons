##Exercise 2

- Consume data from the following api endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Create routes using title as links, and id for "article" as parameter.
- Create two routes, the main  route ('/') is for the list of title links, and the ('/detail') route for the article details.
- Please separate concerns by utilizing a factory to consume data for your application.
- Utilize templateUrl, rather than inline templates in your routes.

Please don't copy and paste code. Write it from memory. If you need to refer to the code, that's ok, but please write it from memory. It's the only way it will stick, and maximize comprehension. Don't be shy about asking for help if you get stuck.

Please post your code to github, and email me the link. This does count for a grade.
