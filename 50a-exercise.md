Take your application, and extract it into modules as demonstrated in the example. Use method chaining, and be sure to use the correct order when you load your .js files in your index.html page. This is were Webpack or another bundler can come in handy, especially as your project grows and gets more complex.

Please don't copy and paste code. Write it from memory. If you need to refer to the code, that's ok, but please write it from memory. It's the only way it will stick, and maximize comprehension. Don't be shy about asking for help if you get stuck.

Please post your code to github, and email me the link. This does count for a grade.
